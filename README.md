# food_ordering_app
### Pure JavaScript (no library or framework whatsoever!)

Basic UI of a food ordering app with sorting, filtering, searching and more.

Reusable functions, modularized code (although just one JS file) using Flexbox for styling (even though I have added almost no styling to this yet - but we will work on this in future videos!)

This project was inspired by my favorite YouTuber - Akshay Saini:
